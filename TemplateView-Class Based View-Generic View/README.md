In the context of Django and many programming frameworks, "generic" refers to something that is designed to be broadly applicable and reusable. Specifically, in Django, generic views are pre-built views that handle common tasks and patterns, allowing you to implement these patterns with less code and effort. They provide a way to encapsulate common functionality and make it easier to create certain types of views.

### Key Characteristics of Generic Views

1. **Reusability**: Generic views are designed to be reused across different parts of your application. Instead of writing similar code multiple times, you can use a generic view and configure it to meet your needs.

2. **Simplicity**: By using generic views, you can avoid boilerplate code. This makes your codebase cleaner and easier to maintain.

3. **Configurability**: Generic views are highly configurable. You can override methods and attributes to customize their behavior.

### Common Generic Views in Django

Django provides several generic views for common tasks. Here are a few examples:

- **TemplateView**: Renders a specified template.
- **ListView**: Displays a list of objects from a queryset.
- **DetailView**: Displays a single object.
- **CreateView**: Displays a form for creating a new object and saves it.
- **UpdateView**: Displays a form for editing an existing object and saves it.
- **DeleteView**: Displays a confirmation page and deletes an object.
