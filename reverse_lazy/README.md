In Django, `reverse_lazy` is used for URL reversing, similar to the `reverse` function, but with one key difference: it's lazy, meaning it doesn't execute the URL resolution until it's needed. This is particularly useful when you're dealing with class-based views (CBVs) or situations where the URL might not be immediately available, like when defining `urls` or redirects at the module level.

### Real-Life Example:

**Scenario:** Imagine you're managing a simple blog website. After a user submits a form to create a new blog post, you want to redirect them to the blog's homepage.

Here's how you might do it using `reverse_lazy` in a class-based view:

```python
from django.urls import reverse_lazy
from django.views.generic.edit import CreateView
from .models import BlogPost

class BlogPostCreateView(CreateView):
    model = BlogPost
    fields = ['title', 'content']
    template_name = 'blogpost_form.html'
    success_url = reverse_lazy('blog:home')  # Redirect to the homepage after a successful post

```

### Explanation:

- **`reverse_lazy('blog:home')`**: This is where `reverse_lazy` shines. The URL to the blog's homepage is not resolved until it's actually needed (when the form is successfully submitted).
  
- **Why not just `reverse('blog:home')`?** In a class-based view like `CreateView`, attributes like `success_url` are defined at the class level. Using `reverse()` here would try to resolve the URL immediately when the class is loaded, which might not be what you want, especially if some parts of your project are not fully initialized yet. `reverse_lazy` delays the URL resolution until it's necessary.

### In Summary:
- Use `reverse_lazy` when you need to define URLs in places where the URL may not be immediately resolvable, such as class attributes or module-level variables.
- It's particularly useful in class-based views where you might need to specify a redirect URL or success URL.
